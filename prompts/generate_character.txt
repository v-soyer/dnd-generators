Generate one of those  NPC. The race, statistics and class must meet the rule requirements of Dungeon and Dragons. After that, i want you to generate a story for this character that is relevant with its statistics and also a trait of this character, this can be something which characterize this NPC easily (example: a patch eye or a good sense of humor). You can have at the end of this prompt some provided info, take them into account in your generation. Write this as a .json file containing all the following fields:
- name (string)
- level (integer)
- race (string)
- class (string)
- statistics (object with a key for FORCE, CHARISMA, INTELLIGENCE, WISDOW, CONSTITUTION and DEXTERITY as integer)
